Rules:

- Boat can carry only the farmer + one item.
- Wolf eats goat if left alone together.
- Goat eats cabbage if left alone together.

 Safe Crossing Steps:

1 Farmer takes Goat across the river
  → Now: Wolf and Cabbage on the left side
  → Goat on the right side
2 Farmer goes back alone
3 Farmer takes Wolf across the river
4 Farmer brings Goat back
  → This keeps the Goat safe from the Wolf
5 Farmer takes Cabbage across the river
  → Goat stays on the left side
6 Farmer goes back alone
7 Farmer takes Goat across the river one last time


Result:

All three (Wolf, Goat, Cabbage) are now safely on the other side of the river.
